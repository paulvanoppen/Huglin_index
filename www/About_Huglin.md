Huglin Index: this index is derived from local climatic and weather data. From daily minimum, maximum and average data, the Huglin index is calculated according to equation 1: $$K\\sum_{1.Apr}^{30.Sep}\\frac{(T_{med}-10)+(T_{min}+10)}{2} ~ (1)\\!$$"
The daily temperature data are reduced by 10 degrees centigrade, which is the temperature below which no growth can be xpected.
